## How to file issues and get help  

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests.

1. For new issues, file your bug or 
feature request as a [new Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite25-PDY123-learn-how-to-observe-manage-and-scale-agentic-ai-apps-using-azure/issues/new).
